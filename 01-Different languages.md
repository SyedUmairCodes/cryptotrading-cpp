# High-Level and Low-Level Programming Languages

High-Level Languages Abstract away the details of the underlying hardware and are  easier to write and understand because they use more human-readable syntax and concepts. Programmers don't need to worry about how the hardware executes the code.

Low-Level Languages provide access to and require understanding of the underlying hardware. Programmers have more control over how the code is executed. They are often used for performance-critical applications where hardware awareness is crucial.


> [!NOTE] 
> The key differentiator between high and low-level languages is the amount of abstraction the language uses to hide the complexity of manually managing the hardware and memory.
 

High-Level languages provide faster development, are easier to learn, and are more portable. Low-Level languages provide greater control over hardware, potential for better performance, suitable for specific applications like real-time and operating systems.
